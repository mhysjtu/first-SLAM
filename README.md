# fist-SLAM
My first SLAM program, learning from gaoxiang12's slambook.
## Learning Roadmap
+ **Main route:**
- gao's video -> read gao's code -> **write the code** -> read book carefully and solver the problem -> **do practice**
+ **Side route:**
- A. For complex parts(e.g. Feature Detection, Epipolar Geometry, etc), read RVC or MVG book to study further.
- B. For Core parts(e.g. Motion Estimation, Nonlinear Optimization, Loop Detection, etc), read RVCMVG book or ETH course's PPT to practice.
## 0809 Feature Detection Code
- in ch7/feature_extraction_orb.cpp
